# Frostbyte
A custom chess engine, written in C. This was inspired by my school project to build a ches program. I wanted to improve upon it by optimizing memory usage and also making a more 'intelligent' AI to play against the user.

## Goals
 - Make an optimized chess engine
 - Keep the code simple
 - Make an 'AI' that is capable of beating players up to 2000 rating
 - No API's for AI move making

## Future Planned Features
 - Player vs Player
 - Player vs Computer
 - Computer vs Computer
